Title: about me

I am Scott Moynes but you can call me `smoynes` (voicing: monospaced).

I think the information superhighway is pretty awesome and this
website is where I put my stuff online. There's not much stuff here
yet, but I value quality more than quantity and hope to share some
cool jazzy things soon.

In the meantime, consider these words from my hero.

<blockquote>
<p>Me having a beautiful wife and great family and friends around me,
all the money I’ve got, all the things that I’ve got, a Ferrari that
I just ripped the top off of and turned into a convertible, the
rings I got, the two mansions on the water, a master’s in criminal
justice, I’m a cop, plus I look good.
</p>
<p>
So to me, shooting 40 percent at the foul line is just God’s way of
saying that nobody’s perfect. If I shot 90 percent from the line, it
just wouldn’t be right.
