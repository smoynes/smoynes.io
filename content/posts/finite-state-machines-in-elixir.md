A confession: I really love coffee but I don't like making it.

Coffee is a truly marvellous elixir composed of two basic ingredients:
water and the seed of a plant. A sip of coffee is a simple pleasure
that comes in many preparations: a simple product from a complicated
process.

To prepare a coffee is usually pretty complicated so I prefer to
purchase my coffee from a local cafe. It is great! They have a few
people behind the counter that make espresso and lattes and of course
someone to take my money.

I noticed that each of the people in the cafe works a little bit like
a state machine and I wondered if I could model one of these state
machines in a computer program.

First, I started with a really simple process: the person purchasing the coffee.
